# A Simple Test

## Synopsis
A short ArM5 story for a one-shot with five new players.
Requiring no knowledge of the system by the players.
Come and play.

Aimed to showcase the magic system by presenting challenges that can be solved by spontaneous casting.
Including a simple storyline that will make the PCs save the day.

PCs are a group of apprentices with arts freshly opened and no special magic related virtue/flaw.
Special systems shell be provided to improve the casting total.

## Main Story
The PCs are all of the same covenant.
They enter a traditional trial/competition to test their skills.
They are sent into a forest and told to reach the other end of the path.
They will be monitored, and their performances will be judged.
They enter as compatitors, but not racers.

They encounter basic challenges at first.

SOMETHING IS WRONG!

They found the problem and defeated it.

## Intro
It is the year 1205, the fourth crusade has just sacked Constantinople, French king Philip has just retook Normandy, and at the other end of the world, Temujin is one year from becoming Genghis Khan. Non of these matter to you now as you are the apprentices of a covenant in a very remote place in the south of France.

PCs are of age 9-12 and taken to the covenant within the path month by their respective parens.

They spent the first year learning Artes Liberales and Latin.

## Chapter One
PCs take a season's course of Magic Theory.

- Ask each PCs what a magus can do
- Explain TeFo
- Cast a spell and ask TeFo
    - Create light at hand
    - Make someone float
    - Put words inside someone's mind
- Ask one to name a TeFo and another for a effect under it.
- Explain Mag and casting
- Explain Range, Duration, Target
- Cast two spells and ask to compare Mag
    - Create a small rock on hand (T,C,I,5) vs. Create a small ruby on hand (T,C,I,11)
    - Teleport a mug with water (T,M,I,5) vs. collecting the spilled water back into it slowly (V,C,G,6)

Time passes and PCs have their arts opened and each specialized in one Te?Fo? of their choosing.

## Chapter Two
PCs enter the competition, rules explained to them:

- Follow the path to the end
- No leaving the path
- Not a race
- No danger
- No harming each other

Some spells are cast on PCs.
PCs are teleported to the beginning of the path, within a forest and only one way forwards.
The path is formed by trees shaped using magic, no sign of crafts.

### Challenge 1: Darkness
Total Darkness.

### Challenge 2: Pool
Large, deep, still, blocking the path.

### Challenge 3: Large Rock
Size +2, blocking the path.

### Challenge 4: Illusion
Thick branches blocking the path.
Some are illusions, some have invisible thorns.
One fake crawl space.

### Challenge 5: Awakened Tree
Large arena, tree will move to grapple PCs.

## Chapter Three
PCs pass the last chapter and enter a maze.
After some short probing, the wooden maze changed into withered wastes.
The trial path is no more.
In the distance, a giant tree can be seen.

A rabbit emerged from the ground, and talked to PCs, imploring them to save its queen.
The queen of this forest is under the attack of a magus and his grogs.

PCs passes two searching grogs and reached the giant tree.
There are spiral stairs around the tree to a hole up the trunk.

When PCs get near the hole, they can hear a man shouting about:

- Where is the acorn?
- Destroy the forest
- You can't escape

If they look inside, a dryad is imprisoned in a magic circle, and a man is looking around.

If they took too long waiting, another group of grog will be back and sound the alarm.

The magus initially think PCs are just random children and tries to scare them away.

When he find out that they are apprentices, he mutters to himself about if he can attack you and if the plan is about to ruin.
The magus decides to imprison PCs using a fire dome as a bargain chip.

The magus creates a firework to summon all grogs when PCs are discovered.

The queen asks PCs to break the circle.
PCs break the circle, the queen controls the tree to swallow all grogs and the magus.
The magus teleports away.

The queen thanks PCs and tells them that she is in charge of the trial but was ambushed by the magus.
A maga from PCs' covenant finally came as a crow, and appologizes to the queen and compliments PCs.

End.
