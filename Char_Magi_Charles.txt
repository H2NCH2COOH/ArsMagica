Description:
    Charles was born as the second son of a minor noble in Burgundy and received very good education in a monastery. His Gentle Gift was discovered by a visiting Jerbiton magus named Luc and was taken as an apprentice. Luc, being a Jerbiton who focused more on academic world than magical, was a doctor in the newly formed University of Paris, and took Charles in as both his apprentice and master student. Studying both Hermetic and liberal arts, Charles worked towards his gauntlet and master's degree at the same time. After 18 years of study, Charles took the oath and became a magus. Luc, satisfied with Charles's academic capabilities, ordered him to travel and experience the wide world before finishing his master's degree. Thus, begins Charles's adventures.
