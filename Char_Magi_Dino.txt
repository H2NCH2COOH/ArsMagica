Description:
    Dino is a large fat man who wears as much decoration as possible and always look down apon everyone. Born as the youngest son of an Milano craftsman family, Dino's Gift made him misery and lonely. At the age of 15, Dino was picked up by an old Verditius magus in an old and reclusive covenant and became an apprentice. Although his parens did tought him well, being the only magus younger than a centry in the covenant, Dino still felt lonely and restricted. All the magus in the covenant had retreated into their own secrets and ignored Dino as much as possible, even his parens. After the gauntlet, Dino left the covenant and decide to find a new foundation to finally prove his worth to the world.
