Description:
    Benaiah is a short man with a stern face. He always wears a rough linen robe, holds a walking staff, and carries a plain bundle. A large iron nail hangs on his neck with a rope. Although looking like a traveling monk, Benaiah is actually one of the Venetores who sworn an oath to fight all supernatural enemies of Christians. Through rigorous training and magical rituals, Benaiah was created by a group of monks and holy magi whom for centuries produced pious warriors with magical power to fight supernatural creatures without the direct blessing of the Divine. The Venetores travel the world, providing help to anyone troubled by supernatural creatures. They excel at physical confrontation and often work alongside with the Church or Hermetic Magi.
