Description:
    Garrulus is a man with a small frame and a reclusive atmosphere. Born in a small and old covenant in the Alps. Having a blatant Gift, he was raised up to become a magus without being tought anything unrelated. Everything went well until the ninth year into his apprenticeship, when a Bonisagus Maga came to visit and took Garrulus as her own. Left the only place he knew, Garrulus was taken to an alien place with unfamiliar people with only the companionship of the magical black cat Mimi. Although he finished his apprenticeship with remarkable result, Garrulus never felt at home, and left to find a new place for himself soon afterwards.
