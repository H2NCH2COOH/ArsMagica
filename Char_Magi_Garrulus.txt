Description:
    Garrulus is a man with a small frame and a big heart who can't be stopped from talking about magic research. Born in a small and old covenant in the Alps with a blatant Gift, he was raised up to become a magus without being taught anything unrelated. Everything went well until the ninth year into his apprenticeship, when a Bonisagus Maga came to visit and took Garrulus as her own. Leaving the only place he knew, Garrulus was taken to an alien place with unfamiliar people. Although he finished his apprenticeship with remarkable result, Garrulus never felt at home, and left to find a new place where he is the master.

            Arcane Ability
        Descroiption:
            Protection from Warping. This is a special ritual that takes about two minutes to perform, and lasts until the next sunrise or sunset. While under the protection of Parma Depravatio, anytime a number of Warping Points are gained, reduce that number by the score of this ability. This may reduce the number to zero. One can only protect oneself with Parma Depravatio. Parma Depravatio itself doesn't cause Warping and can't protect anyone with a Might Score. An active Parma Depravatio has an effective spell level equal to five times its score. Only an individual with The Gift can learn Parma Depravatio. Specialties: protection from one supernatural realm.
