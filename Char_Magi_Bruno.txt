        Type:
            Spell
        Effect:
            ReTe, R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group
            Make a group of objects float in the air and follow you around within a pace as long as you're slower than running. The objects will keep its position relative to you as you move and turn. You can rearrange the objects by concentrating but precise placement requires Perception + Finesse roll. Another effect (e.g., taken by someone, blown by wind) can move any affected object without hindrance and this spell ends on the moved object. The objects should be of the same catagory (e.g., weapons and ammunitions, smithing tools) and casting requisite might apply.
        Level:
            Base 2, +2' Voice, +2' Sun, +2' Group, +1' fancy movements = 25
