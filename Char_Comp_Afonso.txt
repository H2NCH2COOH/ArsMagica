Description:
    Afonso was raised as a mercenary from youth. Compare to his extraordinary capability to fight, his capability to choose the losing side is also extraordinary. Moving from one group to another, Afonso gradually earned his name and became a captain. Accepting his bad luck, Afonso became more and more attracted to strange or risky jobs, which in the end, even landed him a job serving magi.
